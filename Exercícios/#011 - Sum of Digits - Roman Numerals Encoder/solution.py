# Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.
# 
# Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. There cannot be more than 3 identical symbols in a row.
# 
# In Roman numerals:
# 
# 1990 is rendered: 1000=M + 900=CM + 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC.
# 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.
# 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.
# Example:
# 
#    1 -->       "I"
# 1000 -->       "M"
# 1666 --> "MDCLXVI"
# Help:
# 
# Symbol    Value
# I          1
# V          5
# X          10
# L          50
# C          100
# D          500
# M          1,000
